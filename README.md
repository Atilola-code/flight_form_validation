#  Flight Booking Multi-Step Form

A responsive, modern multi-step flight booking form built with **React**, **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **React Hook Form**. 
The form allows users to search flights, select preferences, view ticket information, and proceed through multiple steps with a visual progress indicator — closely styled to a Figma prototype.
